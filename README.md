# PassGen

Free & Secure Password Generator. It can generate a unique code of any length you want (I recommend using 16-digits passwords).
The code can include just numbers or to be mixed - with numbers, lowercase/Uppercase symbols. 
All you need to do is to click the "Generate" button and then double click on your new code to select it and copy it to the clipboard.
Enjoy your experience!
